Exercise 1:  See Github script and pdf
Exercise 2:  See Github script and pdf
  The order printed out is an in-order traversal via recursion - left side,
  trunk, right side.  I believe you are getting at tree traversal in computer
  science, a form of graph traversal which refers to the process of visiting
  each node in a tree data structure, exactly once.  A traversal is classified
  by the order in which the nodes are visited.  Ours was an in-order traversal.
Exercise 3:  See Github script and pdf
  As h gets smaller and smaller, there is an inflection point in the data
  (right around 10-8) where the slope stops decreasing, goes up, then
  alternates between losing data points and trending back up.  I believe this
  teases out a problem with how python stores numbers, particularly rounding
  errors when adding a number that is magnitudes smaller to another number.
Exercise 4:  See Github script and pdf
  In order to be sure my results were reasonable, I compared them with SIR
  models of outbreaks online and studied the differential equations that
  are used for more complex models.  I also ran the simulations many times.

  Please see this Github repository's pdf document for the output from each
  program.  This respository also includes the scripts for each exercise.


  I utilized online help from:
    Stack Overflow - discussion threads.
